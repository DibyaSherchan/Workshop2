    <p class="thomas2">The way he got to know about NCR is when he aquired a fresh NCR cash register in his butcher shop. He had to arrange and transfer the installment payments to the new owner of the butcher shop.
        Since he got more intruigued about NCR he went to the company for a visit which is when he met Jhon J. Range and asked him for a job. He pecked Range's calls repeatedly, with a number of abortive attempts.
        Until he finally was finally hired in November 1896, as a sales apprentice to Range.
